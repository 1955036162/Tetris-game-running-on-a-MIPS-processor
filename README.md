# Tetris game running on a MIPS processor
Duke ECE Five-Fifty Fundamentals of Computer Systems and Engineering - Final Project

Team Members: Yuchuan Li, Yuanrui Zhang

This project mainly contains two parts:
 - a five stage pipelined processor built from scratch with a simplified MIPS-like instruction set (individual work by Yuchuan Li)
 - a tetris game written in Verilog and Assembly running (group work by pair programming)
