# Tetris game running on a MIPS processor
Duke ECE Five-Fifty Fundamentals of Computer Systems and Engineering - Final Project

Author: Yuchuan Li, Yuanrui Zhang

This project mainly contains two parts:
 - A five stage pipelined processor built from scratch with a simplified MIPS-like instruction set(running on Altera FPGA). (individual work by Yuchuan Li)
 - A tetris game written in Verilog(running on Altera FPGA) and Assembly(running on the processor). (group work by pair programming)
